    <p><a href="http://accidentdatacenter.com">Accident Data Center</a> is a site that aggregates local news stories
        regarding traffic accidents from around the United States.
        I take care of the site on a day-to-day basis and implement features requested by the marketing team. Sometimes,
        this involves writing custom PHP plugins; other times, it involves SCSS work. </p>

    <p>Personal injury attorneys rent ad space from Accident Data Center by paying us a monthly fee.
        The site also acts as a place for friends and relatives of those involved in accidents to gather and discuss what happened.</p>

    <p>During the summer of 2015, I wrote a web spider that pulled the professional information for over
        8,000 personal injury attorneys from a large online database.
        We use this information to enrich the siteâ€™s city and accident report pages. You can find the spider's
        source code <a href="https://github.com/RGrun/lawyer-crawl-python">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The site is built using Drupal 7. On average, it gets between 10,000 and 30,000 hits per day.</p>
